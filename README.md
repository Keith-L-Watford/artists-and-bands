# Artist & Band Finder

## Project Description
This project was created to solve the problem of looking up artist/bands to see if they had upcoming tour dates. We utilized the TicketMaster and Deezer APIs to retreive the information. We also used the CSS framework Bulma to aid in design and opted for vanilla JavaScript over jQuery.

## Notes
Our original idea was that the user could localize their search results by adding a zip code and a radius. However, we were unable to format that query correctly within the TicketMaster API. We've also had some issues with CORS that were still trying to resolve. Sometimes it works and sometime it doesnt and we havent yet been able to pinpoint why that is.
