# Artist & Band Finder

## Project Description
This project was created to solve the problem of looking up artist/bands to see if they had upcoming tour dates. We utilized the TicketMaster and Deezer APIs to retreive the information.

## Installation
No installs required. Works best in an updated browser.

## Usage
Type into the search bar an artist or band to find out where, when, and starting price for any upcoming touring dates. Click <a href="https://keith-l-watford.github.io/artists-and-bands/" target="blank">here</a> to see the deployed application or scan the QR code below.<br>

## Notes
Our original idea was that the user could localize their search results by adding a zip code and a radius. However, we were unable to format that query correctly within the TicketMaster API.
